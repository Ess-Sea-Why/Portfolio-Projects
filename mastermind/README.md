# Mastermind.py

I started this project as part of Codecademy's Computer Science Career Path course. The task was to research and build a basic terminal game program. As you can probably tell from the title, I chose to create a version of Mastermind.

I used the IDE PyCharm to work on my project and the website patorjk.com to generate the ASCII art for the in-game title.
