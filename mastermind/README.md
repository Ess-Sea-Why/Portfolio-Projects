# Mastermind.py
I started this project as part of codecademy's Computer Science career path course. The task was to research and build a basic terminal game program. As you can probably tell based on the title, I chose to create a version of mastermind.

I used the IDE PyCharm to work on my project and used the website patorjk.com to generate the ASCII art for the in game title.
